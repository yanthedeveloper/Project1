Drivers to explore
------------------

Our team is planning to explore what the are the primary factors which impact the price of housing in the Atlanta region. Some of the questions that we seek to explain include:
1. What factors are indicative of a stable housing market vs a growing housing market?

2. Which factors are seen as a cause of an increasing housing market and what are seen as more of an effect?

3. Do the type of retail shops, restaurants, and housing offered drive to cost of housing?

4. What factors are more indicative of renting an apartment or home versus purchasing a home?

5. Is there a relationship between household disposable income/interest rates/household net financial wealth and housing price in Atlanta?
6. What are the transportation options?

7. What careers are driving income/housing pricing up? Does lack of employment opportunities drive the pricing curve down?

8. Other drivers to explore: impacts of school district strength, crime rates, median income, proximity to a major city, employment industries, post education options, and other quality of life statistics.
