Drivers to explore
------------------

Our team is planning to explore what the primary factors that have an impact on the housing prices in the Atlanta region are. These are the three main questions that we plan to explore:
• Would the housing price in Atlanta be higher if the owner is a white-collar/blue-collar worker? (2 visuals)
• Would the housing price in Atlanta be higher if the property is owner-occupied/renter-occupied? (2 visuals)
• Among the following six variables (income, family size, crime risk, education, expenditure and air quality), which factor is most strongly correlated with the sales price for housing in Atlanta? (6 visuals)

Rough Breakdown of the Tasks
---------------------------

1. Identify target API
2. Pull data from the API to provide information on the specific variables that we have defined.
3. Perform statistical tests and plot our data to uncover the relationships between our independent variables and our dependent variable. Keep the variables that have a significant impact on the dependent variable and eliminate the variables that do not from our focus.
4. Determine the type of visuals we're going to use
